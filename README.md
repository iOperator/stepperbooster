This Booster Pack utilizes a Texas Instruments DRV8834 (2.2A Low Voltage Stepper w/ 32-step Indexer or Dual Brushed DC Motor Driver) and was mainly designed as an expansion to the MSP430 Launchpad ecosystem.
As indicated by the used IC above it can drive one stepper or two brushed DC motors. Four LEDs at edge of the PCB give a overview of the 'enable', 'step', 'direction' and 'fault' stati.
